# Crowdfunding exploration

using Excel organize and analyze a database of 1,000 projects to uncover any hidden trends.


## Roadmap

- Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color
    - Create a new column called Percent Funded that uses a formula to find how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.
- Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale. 
    - Create a new column called Average Donation that uses a formula to find how much each project backer paid on average.
    - Create two new columns, one called Parent Category and another called Sub-Category, that use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into the two new, separate columns.

- Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.
- Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country

- Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes your initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category

- Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category
- The dates in the deadline and launched_at columns use Unix timestamps, convert these timestamps to a normal date.
    - Create a new column named Date Created Conversion
    - Create a new column named Date Ended Conversion
    - Create a new sheet with a pivot table that has a column of outcome, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of outcome, and filters based on parent category and Years.

- Using the COUNTIFS() formula, count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within the ranges listed above. Populate the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns with these data points.
- Add up each of the values in the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns to populate the Total Projects column. Then, using a mathematical formula, find the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range.
- Create a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goal amount and its chances of success, failure, or cancellation.
- Use Excel to evaluate the following values for successful campaigns, and then do the same for unsuccessful campaigns

## Conclusions
- Theater is the most common type of crowdfunding campaign, nearly doubling the amount of the next two highest, film & video, followed by music.
- On average, July is the time of the year with the best chances of having a successful campaign.
- Goals of $15,000 to $34,999 appear most likely to have success.
## Limitations of data set
- The data does not provide any type of specifics about the actual donors, their location within their country, their demographics or size of donations.
- The reasoning behind the countries chosen for analysis is also not known
- Reasons why some campaigns were cancelled
## Possible other explorations
- Currency conversion of the donations to explore more which types of campaigns make the most per dollar
- Length of time for successful campaign vs failed campaign.
- Comparing successful vs failed and if they were a staff pick or a spotlight campaign
